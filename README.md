# Personal TV Guide
This is some simple Python code to scrape my watchlist data from JustWatch and turn it into HTML to serve as my own TV Guide.

## Badges
All badges are from [Shields.io](https://shields.io/), which I probably saw originally on [awesome-badges](https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges).

## Scraping
The code does not currently have anything to automate authentication, so it just pauses to allow you to type in your credentials. After that, things go pretty smoothly.

## Future
I plan to scrape my movie watchlist as well. I only began with TV data as my list was much shorter (~60 shows vs. 800+ movies!).
