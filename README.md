# Personal TV Guide
This is some simple Python code to scrape my watchlist data from JustWatch and turn it into HTML to serve as my own TV Guide.

## Background
Remember the weekly TV guide that came with the newspaper? It was the only useful thing in there - aside from the comic section.

(I really need to figure out where to watch some *Kate & Allie* - great show!)

## Scraping
The code does not currently have anything to automate authentication, so it just pauses to allow you to type in your credentials. After that, things go pretty smoothly.
